Gitface is my experimental git commit viewer/visualiser.

Its an itch scratching of

* me playing with node.js and d3.js
* visualising git commits (particularly with non-topological sorting)
* experimenting with git structure more deeply

## You need

* node.js 0.4.6-ish

via npm

* express
* jade
* underscore
* async

## run it

Run with `node app.js`

## problems

Its hard coded to one repo and my team at the moment.
